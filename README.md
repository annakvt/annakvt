### ğŸ’¬  About Me
- I'm a 10th grade high school student and aspiring computer science major, interesting in applying my studies to the field of __*healthcare*__ ğŸ§¬ or __*AI*__ ğŸ¤–
- But for now, I'm immersing myself in different oppourtunities and applications of CS to experience everything I can! <br>(I have so many interests)
- Outside of school and my journey in CS, I'm an avid language-learning bookworm with a passion for competitive dance!
